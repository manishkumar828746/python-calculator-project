# python-calculator-project
Excited to share my latest Python projectâ€”a fully-functional Calculator! from the #CodSoft internship under the guidance of Mr. Divakar Kushwaha Sir from Ducat Noida !!!

 Project Overview: I recently developed a Python-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project not only helped me enhance my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of Python's functionalities and GUI libraries.

 Technologies Used:

Python: For core logic implementation.

Tkinter: For creating the user-friendly graphical interface.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): To structure the project efficiently.

 Key Features:

Simple and Intuitive UI: Easy-to-navigate interface.

Error Handling: Effective management of common user input errors.

Extendable: Designed to easily incorporate additional functions.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸ˜Š
